Create a frontend application – personal student account. In this app, on the home page
student should see the list of the courses he/she is assigned to. By clicking on the concrete
course, the site should redirect him to separate page with course details. On that page the
user should see the table with all topics assigned to that course, its planned date, short
description and type – lecture or practical session. If the topic has already passed it should
be marked as “passed”, if not - “upcoming”. The user should be able to add some notes to
each topic. The user should be able to sort the table by Name and Date columns and has an
ability to filter topics by Name. All data mentioned here is mocked, but we suggest using
some delay to emulate data processing and to show loading indicator.
The user should be authorized to see those pages. If he tries to go to some page without
being authorized yet, he should be redirected to login page. The user should be able to log
out from the application. User should see his initials in the header.
